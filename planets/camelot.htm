					Camelot, a village on PX1-767, is considered to be the past and future home of King Arthur and his Round Table. The walled town is reminiscent of medieval England, and the public square prominently displays a sword embedded in a stone. SG-1 learned the gate address for Camelot from the log in Merlin's phase-shift device, and they came searching for Merlin's weapon. They were welcomed by Meurik, the governor of the village, and Antonius, the village historian, who informed them that King Arthur had not been mortally wounded by Mordred, as Earth legends tell, but that Arthur had defeated Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, after which he and his fellow knights had set off through the Great Ring to find the Sangreal, or the Holy Grail, and one day he will return to them. Everyone in the village, including Valencia and her young brother Ramus, awaits and prepares for Arthur's return, but Merlin's name is rarely mentioned in public. Feared and misunderstood, Merlin is seen as a wizard of darkness, and it is forbidden to enter his library. Despite the warnings, SG-1 searched Merlin's library, and in doing so, unleashed the curse of the Black Knight. For causing the death of Antonius, they were ordered to leave, but when the Black Knight was defeated, they were hailed as heroes. From Meurik they learned that the device they sought is the Sangreal, the blood-red stone that Merlin wore as a pendant, and according to Merlin's prophecy, Arthur and his Knights journeyed to Castiana, Sahal, and Vagon Brei in search of it. Although the Sangreal was not found on those three worlds, combining the coordinates for Castiana, Sahal, and Vagon Brei produced a gate address that eventually led to Merlin's weapon.</p>
